        <p>
            <strong>Earth</strong>,our home, is the <i>third</i> planet from the sun. 
            It's the only planet known to have an atmosphere containing 
            <strong>free oxygen, oceans of water on its surface and, of course, 
            life.</strong>

        <h2 style="color: #d33d1f;">Orbit and Rotation</h2>
        <h3 style="color: #d33d1f;">Rotation</h3>
        <p>
            Earth's axis of rotation is tilted in relation to the 
            ecliptic plane, an imaginary surface through the planet's 
            orbit around the sun. This means the Northern and Southern
            hemispheres will sometimes point toward or away from the
            sun depending on the time of year, and this changes the 
            amount of light the hemispheres receive, resulting in the
            <strong>seasons.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Earth's rotation period relative to the fixed stars, 
           called its stellar day by the International Earth Rotation 
           and Reference Systems Service (IERS), is 86,164.0989 seconds 
           of mean solar time (UT1), or 23h 56m 4.0989s. Earth's rotation 
           period relative to the precessing or moving mean vernal equinox,
           misnamed its sidereal day, is 86,164.0905 seconds of mean solar 
           time (UT1) (23h 56m 4.0905s). Thus the sidereal day is shorter 
           than the stellar day by about 8.4 ms.[187] The length of the 
           mean solar day in SI seconds is available 
           from the IERS for the periods 1623–2005[188] and 1962–2005.

        <h3>Orbit</h3>
        <p>Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 
            150 million km (93 million mi) every 365.2564 mean solar days,
            or one sidereal year. This gives an apparent movement of the
            Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about 
            1°/day, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 
            12 hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 
            24 hours—a solar day—for Earth to complete a full 
            rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the meridian. 
            The orbital speed of Earth averages about 29.78 km/s 
            (107,200 km/h; 66,600 mph), which is fast enough to 
            travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter, about 12,742 km (7,918 mi), 
            in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, 384,000 km (239,000 mi), 
            in about 3.5 hours.</p>
